## ðŸš¨ Critical Path Items

**Must be completed before adding new features:**

1. **Unit tests for existing services** - Prevent regressions
2. **Pre-commit hooks installation** - Enforce code quality
3. **GitHub Actions CI setup** - Automate testing
4. **Fix deployment warnings** - Ensure production stability

**Should be completed before production:**

1. **Integration tests for all APIs** - Ensure system reliability
2. **Security testing** - Protect against vulnerabilities
3. **Performance baselines** - Monitor system health
4. **E2E workflow tests** - Validate user experience

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Start Checklist

To get started with testing immediately:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 2. Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 3. Run existing structure test
python test_structure.py

# 4. Run sample tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh --lint

# 5. Check coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# 6. View results
open htmlcov/index.html
```
